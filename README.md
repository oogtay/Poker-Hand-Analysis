Poker Hand Analysis

This project analyzes poker hand histories to explore player behavior, bet sizing tendencies, and aggression dynamics across different hand types and game streets. The analysis includes both large-scale simulated hand data and 83 hands from professional World Series of Poker (WSOP) events to compare population-level and expert-level trends.

Project Overview

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on player actions, bet sizing, and aggression rates.

Quantified first-in aggression percentages (bet/raise share) and checked frequencies by position and hand type.

Investigated turn bet sizing distributions and the relationship between hand categories and pot commitment levels.

Analyzed WSOP hands to derive player-level aggression indices and identify stylistic differences among professionals.
